If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra) Everything that can be invented has been invented. (Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Office of Patents, 1899) It’s a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, but we also don’t learn from our successes. (Keith Braithwaite) Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. (Ralph Johnson)
